			Chocolate milk is delicious. It's a bad habit, but I drink at least one cup of it a day. Store bought mixes are okay, but I like a stronger chocolate flavor, so I like to make my own.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>2oz hot water (doesn't have to be boiling, but more than warm. You want to melt the chocolate.)</li>
				<li>18oz white milk
					<ul>
						<li>Whole milk is <i>amazing</i> with this but very unhealthy. I usually drink two percent, but you do you.</li>
						<!--No, it is not unhealthy, look at meeee
							I'm tinyyyy, I need to drink whole milk frequently, lol
							I drink whole milk everyday, but my weight isn't still gain
